## Design Principles for Proposal Decks

### Visual Hierarchy

1. **Use the "Attention Economy" principle:**
   - Title slide: Bold, confident, branded
   - Problem/opportunity slides: Dark or dramatic to create urgency
   - Solution slides: Light, optimistic, spacious
   - Pricing slide: Clean, confident, no clutter
   - Closing slide: Strong call-to-action

2. **Information Density:**
   - Complex sections (deliverables, timeline): More structured, potentially more dense
   - Strategic sections (problem, solution): More whitespace, fewer words
   - Transition slides: Minimal text, strong visual

### Color Strategy

**Choose colors that reflect your brand AND the proposal topic:**

For **Technology/Innovation** proposals:

- Primary: `0A2463` (tech blue) or `2C3E50` (slate)
- Secondary: `3BCEAC` (teal) or `00D9FF` (cyan)
- Accent: `FB3640` (red) or `FFC857` (amber)

For **Consulting/Strategy** proposals:

- Primary: `1E3A5F` (navy) or `2D3748` (charcoal)
- Secondary: `4A90E2` (sky blue) or `6C757D` (gray)
- Accent: `D4AF37` (gold) or `E74C3C` (coral)

For **Creative/Design** proposals:

- Primary: `6C2E46` (burgundy) or `1A1A2E` (midnight)
- Secondary: `F39C12` (orange) or `9B59B6` (purple)
- Accent: `ECF0F1` (off-white) or `3498DB` (bright blue)

For **Healthcare/Medical** proposals:

- Primary: `005073` (medical blue) or `2C5F2D` (forest green)
- Secondary: `70C1B3` (seafoam) or `4A7C59` (sage)
- Accent: `E63946` (red cross) or `F1FAEE` (clean white)

### Typography for Proposals

**Font Pairings:**

- **Professional**: Calibri (headers) + Calibri Light (body)
- **Modern**: Arial Black (headers) + Arial (body)
- **Traditional**: Georgia (headers) + Calibri (body)
- **Tech-forward**: Trebuchet MS (headers) + Calibri (body)

**Size Guidelines:**

- Cover title: 44-54pt bold
- Section titles: 36-40pt bold
- Subsection headers: 24-28pt bold
- Body text: 14-18pt
- Fine print: 10-12pt

### Layout Patterns

**For Problem Slides:**

- Dark background
- Large, bold statement of the problem
- Supporting bullets or stats

**For Solution Slides:**

### Cover Slide

- Company logo prominent
- Client name personalized
- Clear, compelling title
- Professional but not generic
- Consider: Tagline that captures the value proposition

### About Us / Credentials

- Include client logos if you have permission
- Brief company description (2-3 sentences max)
- Key team members if relevant to the proposal

### Problem Statement

- Break down components transparently
- Include payment terms
- Consider showing ROI or cost comparison
- Optional: Tiered pricing or options
- Address common pricing questions preemptively

### FAQ

## Writing Style for Proposals

### Tone

- **Confident, not arrogant**: State your capabilities clearly without overselling
- **Specific, not vague**: Use concrete examples and numbers
- **Client-focused**: Use "you" and "your" more than "we" and "our"
- **Professional but human**: Avoid corporate jargon while maintaining professionalism

### Language Patterns

**Instead of vague claims:**

- ❌ "We have extensive experience"
- ✅ "We've completed 40+ similar projects across 15 industries"

**Instead of feature-focused:**

- ❌ "Our solution includes automated reporting"
- ✅ "You'll save 10 hours per week with automated reporting"

**Instead of passive language:**

- ❌ "The project will be completed in 3 months"
- ✅ "We'll deliver your solution in 3 months"

**Instead of generic benefits:**

- ❌ "Increased efficiency and better results"
- ✅ "Process 250% more deals per month while reducing review time by 75%"

### Content Density

- Problem slides: 3-5 bullet points maximum
- Solution slides: Focus on big picture, save details for deliverables
- Deliverables: Can be denser, but use visual organization
- Timeline: Visual > text
- Pricing: Minimal text, maximum clarity

---

## Common Proposal Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Starting with your company**: Lead with the client's problem, not your history
2. **Vague deliverables**: Be specific about what you'll deliver and when
3. **Hiding the price**: Don't save pricing for a separate document or conversation
4. **Too much text**: Proposals should be skimmable with clear visual hierarchy
5. **Generic content**: Customize every proposal to the specific client
6. **No social proof**: Include case studies, metrics, or testimonials
7. **Unclear next steps**: Always end with specific actions and timeline
8. **Overselling**: Let your credentials and case studies speak for themselves
9. **Ignoring objections**: Use FAQ to address common concerns
10. **Poor visual design**: A proposal's appearance affects perceived quality

## Technical Implementation Notes

### When Using pptxgenjs (Creating from Scratch)

```javascript
// Use master layouts for consistency
pres.defineSlideMaster({
  title: "PROPOSAL_MASTER",
  background: { color: "FFFFFF" },
  objects: [
    // Add consistent header/footer elements
  ],
});

// Color scheme variables
const colors = {
  primary: "1E3A5F",
  secondary: "4A90E2",
  accent: "D4AF37",
  dark: "2D3748",
  light: "F7FAFC",
};

// Typography variables
const fonts = {
  header: { face: "Calibri", size: 36, bold: true },
  subheader: { face: "Calibri", size: 24, bold: true },
  body: { face: "Calibri", size: 16 },
  caption: { face: "Calibri", size: 12 },
};
```

### When Using Templates (Editing Approach)

1. Start with a professional template that has:
   - Consistent color scheme
   - Multiple layout options
   - Professional typography

2. Map your content to existing slides:
   - Cover → Title slide
   - About Us → Company overview layout
   - Problem → Dark background impactful slide
   - Solution → Visual solution layout
   - Deliverables → Grid or list layout
   - Timeline → Timeline layout
   - Pricing → Clean pricing layout
   - Closing → Call-to-action layout

3. Maintain visual consistency across all slides

## Final Notes

**Remember**: A proposal is not just information—it's persuasion. Every slide should build confidence, address concerns, and move the client toward saying yes.

**The goal**: Make it easy for the client to:

1. Understand what you're proposing
2. See why you're qualified
3. Know what they'll receive
4. Feel confident in the investment
5. Take the next step

**Success criteria**: The client can forward your proposal to a decision-maker who wasn't in the meeting, and that person can understand and support the proposal without additional context.
